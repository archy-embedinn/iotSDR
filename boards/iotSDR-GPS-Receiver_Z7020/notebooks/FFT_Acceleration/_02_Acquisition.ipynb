    "## Background\n",
    "This code implements the **parallel code phase search** algorithm, which is based on the mathematical concept of circular convolution. This method requires the usage of multiple fft operations, but it will find a satellite in the data (if one exists) in  single iteration. As with all of the algorithms, the parallel code phase search will need to be executed at multiple frequencies to account for the doppler shift as the satellite moves across the sky. It is possible that we will need to use a different algorithm when the code is running on an embedded platform.\n",

    "Experimentation has shown that a 14ms data segment gives the best result when starting from the beginning of the launch data. The generated data only needs 1ms to get a successful acquisition. Besides speed, the issue with using a longer section of data is that a navigation data bit transition can cause the circular convolution to cancel itself out, and weaken or eliminate the acquisition of a satellite. Remember that these are 20ms apart, so if a 20ms signal section were used, the probability of a bit transition being present would be around 50 percent. Remember that a 11 or a -1-1 in the navigation message would not be a transition."
